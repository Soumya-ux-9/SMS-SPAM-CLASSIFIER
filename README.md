Overview

This SMS Spam Classifier uses text messages (SMS) as input and classifies them into two categories: ham (legitimate) or spam. The project involves preprocessing the text data, extracting features, and training a machine learning model to make accurate predictions.

Key techniques used:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, removing stopwords, etc.)
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction
Various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)
Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score)

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. The dataset can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository or similar sources.

Columns:

label: Contains the class labels (spam or ham)
message: The actual text message (SMS)
Installation

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SMS-Spam-Classifier.git
cd SMS-Spam-Classifier
Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage

1. Data Preprocessing
To preprocess the data and prepare it for model training:

bash
Copy code
python src/data_preprocessing.py --input data/sms_spam_dataset.csv --output data/processed_data.csv
2. Train the Model
Train the spam classifier using the processed data:

bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py --input data/processed_data.csv --model_output models/spam_classifier.pkl
3. Predict
Use the trained model to classify new SMS messages:

bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py --model models/spam_classifier.pkl --message "Your free prize is waiting!"
Model

The following machine learning algorithms have been experimented with:

Naive Bayes (Multinomial)
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
The final model was chosen based on the best performance metrics.

Results

The model performance has been evaluated using metrics like:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-score
These metrics are calculated on the test set to evaluate the effectiveness of the classifier.

Sample results:

Algorithm	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-score
Naive Bayes	97.5%	96.8%	95.5%	96.1%
Logistic Regression	98.2%	97.6%	96.9%	97.2%
